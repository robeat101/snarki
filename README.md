snarki
======

Snarki is the name of the app that we developed at HackMIT 2013. It is a totally irrevererent attempt to inject 
some humor into our lives. The app asks you for your mood, and starts developing a conversation based off that.
Currently, you can interact with the app via pre-filled options. The app's responses are spoken using the Google 
TextToSpeech Engine, which adds another level of the app behaving as an "annoying intelligence". 


It is the very first Android application that any of us has ever created. It is definitely a bit rough around the 
edges.

The major themes were simplicity, large doses of a sarcastic attitude, and some sleep-deprived, caffiene-fueled college 
students who had no idea what to do at their first hackathon.

It's been real.
